Since its discovery, the Hippo pathway has emerged as a central signaling 
network in mammalian cells. Canonical signaling through the Hippo pathway core 
components (MST1/2, LATS1/2, YAP and TAZ) is important for development and 
tissue homeostasis while aberrant signaling through the Hippo pathway has been 
implicated in multiple pathologies, including cancer. Recent studies have 
uncovered new roles for the Hippo pathway in immunology. In this review, we 
summarize the mechanisms by which Hippo signaling in pathogen-infected or 
neoplastic cells affects the activities of immune cells that respond to these 
threats. We further discuss how Hippo signaling functions as part of an immune 
response. Finally, we review how immune cell-intrinsic Hippo signaling modulates 
the development/function of leukocytes and propose directions for future work.
