BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) comprises a group of 
neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders characterized by deficits in social 
interactions, interpersonal communication, repetitive and stereotyped behaviors 
and may be associated with intellectual disabilities. The description of ASD as 
a synaptopathology highlights the importance of the synapse and the implication 
of ion channels in the etiology of these disorders.
METHODS: A narrative and critical review of the relevant papers from 1982 to 
2017 known by the authors was conducted.
RESULTS: Genome-wide linkages, association studies, and genetic analyses of 
patients with ASD have led to the identification of several candidate genes and 
mutations linked to ASD. Many of the candidate genes encode for proteins 
involved in neuronal development and regulation of synaptic function including 
ion channels and actors implicated in synapse formation. The involvement of ion 
channels in ASD is of great interest as they represent attractive therapeutic 
targets. In agreement with this view, recent findings have shown that drugs 
modulating ion channel function are effective for the treatment of certain types 
of patients with ASD.
CONCLUSION: This review describes the genetic aspects of ASD with a focus on 
genes encoding ion channels and highlights the therapeutic implications of ion 
channels in the treatment of ASD.
