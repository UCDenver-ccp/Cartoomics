Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a key regulator of 
numerous physiological functions, including the immune response. As pathogens 
elicit an acute phase response with concerted activation of STAT3, they are 
confronted with two evolutionary options: either curtail it or employ it. This 
has important consequences for the host, since abnormal STAT3 function is 
associated with cancer development and other diseases. This review provides a 
comprehensive outline of how human viruses cope with STAT3-mediated inflammation 
and how this affects the host. Finally, we discuss STAT3 as a potential target 
for antiviral therapy.
