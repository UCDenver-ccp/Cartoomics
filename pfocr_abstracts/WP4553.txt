Epigenetic modifiers have emerged as critical factors governing the biology of 
different cancers. Herein we show that FBXL10 (also called KDM2B or JHDM1B), an 
important member of Polycomb repressive complexes, is overexpressed in human 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) tissues and the derived cell lines. 
Knocking down FBXL10 by specific short hairpin RNAs in DLBCL cells inhibits cell 
proliferation and induces apoptosis in vitro. Moreover, FBXL10 depletion in 
DLBCL cells abrogates tumor growth in mouse xenograft models. Through the 
analysis of RNA sequencing, we find that one of the key derepressed genes by 
depletion of FBXL10 is DUSP6, encodingÂ a phosphatase for ERK1/2. Mechanistically 
FBXL10 maintains the silencing of DUSP6 expression via recruitment of Polycomb 
group proteins and deposition of repressive histone modifications at the DUSP6 
promoter. Consistently, FBXL10 is required for ERK1/2 phosphorylation in DLBCL 
cells. Furthermore, we show that ERK1/2 activation and the proliferation rate of 
FBXL10-depleted cells can be rescued by downregulation of DUSP6 expression. 
These findings indicate that FBXL10 may be a promising therapeutic target in 
DLBCL and establish a link of epigenetic regulators to kinase signaling 
pathways.
