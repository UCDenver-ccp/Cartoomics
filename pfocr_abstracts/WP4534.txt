Yes-associated protein (YAP) and its paralog WW domain containing transcription 
regulator 1 (TAZ) are important regulators of multiple cellular functions such 
as proliferation, differentiation, and survival. On the tissue level, YAP/TAZ 
are essential for embryonic development, organ size control and regeneration, 
while their deregulation leads to carcinogenesis or other diseases. As an 
underlying principle for YAP/TAZ-mediated regulation of biological functions, a 
growing body of research reveals that YAP/TAZ play a central role in delivering 
information of mechanical environments surrounding cells to the nucleus 
transcriptional machinery. In this review, we discuss mechanical cue-dependent 
regulatory mechanisms for YAP/TAZ functions, as well as their clinical 
significance in cancer progression and treatment.
