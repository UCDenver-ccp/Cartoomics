  It is established that a decrease in β-cell number and deficiency in the 
  function of existing β-cells contribute to type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
  Therefore, a major focus of current research is to identify novel methods of 
  improving the number and function of β-cells, so as to prevent and/or postpone 
  the development of diabetes mellitus and potentially reverse diabetes mellitus. 
  Based on prior knowledge of the above-mentioned causes, promising therapeutic 
  approaches may include direct transplantation of islets, implantation and 
  subsequent induced differentiation of progenitors/stem cells to β-cells, 
  replication of pre-existing β-cells, or activation of endogenous β-cell 
  progenitors. More recently, with regards to cell replacement and regenerative 
  treatment for diabetes patients, the identification of cellular signaling 
  pathways with related genes or corresponding proteins involved in diabetes has 
  become a topic of interest. However, the majority of pathways and molecules 
  associated with β-cells remain unresolved, and the specialized functions of 
  known pathways remain unclear, particularly in humans. The current article has 
  evaluated the progress of research on pivotal cellular signaling pathways 
  involved with β-cell proliferation and survival, and their validity for 
  therapeutic adult β-cell regeneration in diabetes. More efforts are required to 
  elucidate the cellular events involved in human β-cell proliferation in terms of 
  the underlying mechanisms and functions.
