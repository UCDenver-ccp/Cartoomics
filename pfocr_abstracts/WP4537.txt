Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death around the globe. 
Cardiac deterioration is associated with irreversible cardiomyocyte loss. 
Understanding how the cardiovascular system develops and the pathological 
processes of cardiac disease will contribute to finding novel and preventive 
therapeutic methods. The canonical Hippo tumor suppressor pathway in mammalian 
cells is primarily composed of the MST1/2-SAV1-LATS1/2-MOB1-YAP/TAZ cascade. 
Continuing research on this pathway has identified other factors like RASSF1A, 
Nf2, MAP4Ks, and NDR1/2, further enriching our knowledge of the Hippo-YAP 
pathway. YAP, the core effecter of the Hippo pathway, may accumulate in the 
nucleus and initiate transcriptional activity if the pathway is inhibited. The 
role of Hippo signaling has been widely investigated in organ development and 
cancers. A heart of normal size and function which is critical for survival 
could not be generated without the proper regulation of the Hippo tumor 
suppressor pathway. Recent research has demonstrated a novel role of Hippo 
signaling in cardiovascular disease in the context of development, hypertrophy, 
angiogenesis, regeneration, apoptosis, and autophagy. In this review, we 
summarize the current knowledge of how Hippo signaling modulates pathological 
processes in cardiovascular disease and discuss potential molecular therapeutic 
targets.
