17β-estradiol (E2) can contribute to the progression of epithelial ovarian 
cancer (EOC). Although the majority of patients with EOC are postmenopausal 
woman, when de novo estrogen production in the ovary has ceased, ovarian cancer 
cells remain exposed to estrogens synthesized locally in the cancer cells from 
inactive sulfonated steroid hormone precursors-such as estrone sulfate taken up 
from the circulation via the sulfatase pathway. An abundance of the 
estrogen-modifying enzymes, including estrogen-activating steroid sulfatase 
(STS) and estrogen-inactivating estrogen-sulfotransferase (SULT1E1), is 
important for providing active estrogen to EOC cells. Therefore, the present 
study determined the levels of SULT1E1, STS and estrogen receptor α (ERα) 
protein in paraffin-embedded specimens from 206 patients with Federation of 
Gynecology and Obstetrics stage II-IV EOC treated with debulking surgery and 
standard platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy. The levels of STS, SULT1E1 and 
ERα were assessed by automated quantitative microscopy-based image analysis 
subsequent to immunohistochemical staining. Significantly higher SULT1E1 levels 
were observed in better differentiated EOC tumors compared to grade 3 EOC tumors 
(P=0.001). STS and SULT1E1 levels were positively associated with ERα abundance 
(P<0.001 and P=0.001, respectively). In advanced stage high-grade serous EOC 
(HGSOC; n=132), the most frequent and lethal type of ovarian cancer, SULT1E1 
expression was significantly associated with a better overall survival rate 
(hazard ratio 0.66, 95% confidence interval, 0.45-0.94; P=0.005). These results 
highlight the importance of SULT1E1-mediated estrogen inactivation in EOC, 
particularly HGSOC. Therefore, targeting the sulfatase pathway is a potential 
endocrine therapeutic intervention for certain patients with estrogen-responsive 
EOC.
