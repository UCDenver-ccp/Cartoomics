  BACKGROUND: Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) are a group of cerebellar diseases 
  characterized by progressive ataxia and cerebellar atrophy. Several forms of 
  SCAs are caused by missense mutations or deletions in genes related to calcium 
  signaling in Purkinje cells. Among them, spinocerebellar ataxia type 14 (SCA14) 
  is caused by missense mutations in PRKCG gene which encodes protein kinase C 
  gamma (PKCγ). It is remarkable that in several cases in which SCA is caused by 
  point mutations in an individual gene, the affected genes are involved in the 
  PKCγ signaling pathway and calcium signaling which is not only crucial for 
  proper Purkinje cell function but is also involved in the control of Purkinje 
  cell dendritic development. In this review, we will focus on the PKCγ signaling 
  related genes and calcium signaling related genes then discuss their role for 
  both Purkinje cell dendritic development and cerebellar ataxia.
  METHODS: Research related to SCAs and Purkinje cell dendritic development is 
  reviewed.
  RESULTS: PKCγ dysregulation causes abnormal Purkinje cell dendritic development 
  and SCA14. Carbonic anhydrase related protein 8 (Car8) encoding CAR8 and Itpr1 
  encoding IP3R1were identified as upregulated genes in one of SCA14 mouse model. 
  IP3R1, CAR8 and PKCγ proteins are strongly and specifically expressed in 
  Purkinje cells. The common function among them is that they are involved in the 
  regulation of calcium homeostasis in Purkinje cells and their dysfunction causes 
  ataxia in mouse and human. Furthermore, disruption of intracellular calcium 
  homeostasis caused by mutations in some calcium channels in Purkinje cells links 
  to abnormal Purkinje cell dendritic development and the pathogenesis of several 
  SCAs.
  CONCLUSION: Once PKCγ signaling related genes and calcium signaling related 
  genes are disturbed, the normal dendritic development of Purkinje cells is 
  impaired as well as the integration of signals from other neurons, resulting in 
  abnormal development, cerebellar dysfunction and eventually Purkinje cell loss.
