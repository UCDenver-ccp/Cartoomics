Two classes of dynein power long-distance cargo transport in different cellular 
contexts. Cytoplasmic dynein-1 is responsible for the majority of transport 
toward microtubule minus ends in the cell interior. Dynein-2, also known as 
intraflagellar transport dynein, moves cargoes along the axoneme of eukaryotic 
cilia and flagella. Both dyneins operate as large ATP-driven motor complexes, 
whose dysfunction is associated with a group of human disorders. But how similar 
are their mechanisms of action and regulation? To examine this question, this 
review focuses on recent advances in dynein-1 and -2 research, and probes to 
what extent the emerging principles of dynein-1 transport could apply to or 
differ from those of the less well-understood dynein-2 mechanoenzyme.

Conflict of interest statement: The Author declares that there are no competing 
interests associated with this manuscript. NOTE ADDED IN PROOF: An analysis of 
dynein-2 subunit interactions via a visible immunoprecipitation (VIP) assay has 
been published, demonstrating interactions between WDR60 and TCTEX1/3-TCTEX1D2; 
WDR34 and LC8 and Roadblock; and the intermediate chain-light chain complex with 
the heavy chain and light-intermediate chain [148].
