Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is a genetic condition characterized by 
early contractures, skeletal muscle weakness, and cardiomyopathy. During the 
last 20 years, various genetic approaches led to the identification of causal 
genes of EDMD and related disorders, all encoding nuclear envelope proteins. By 
their respective localization either at the inner nuclear membrane or the outer 
nuclear membrane, these proteins interact with each other and establish a 
connection between the nucleus and the cytoskeleton. Beside this physical link, 
these proteins are also involved in mechanotransduction, responding to 
environmental cues, such as increased tension of the cytoskeleton, by the 
activation or repression of specific sets of genes. This ability of cells to 
adapt to environmental conditions is altered in EDMD. Increased knowledge on the 
pathophysiology of EDMD has led to the development of drug or gene therapies 
that have been tested on mouse models. This review proposed an overview of the 
functions played by the different proteins involved in EDMD and related 
disorders and the current therapeutic approaches tested so far.
