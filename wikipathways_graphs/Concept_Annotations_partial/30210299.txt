ProBDNF, mBDNF and GABAAR Interplay
In the cerebral cortex, BDNF/TrkB signaling controls the development of interneurons (Yuan et al., 2016) and the expression of the presynaptic GABA synthetic enzyme GAD65 (Sánchez-Huertas and Rico, 2011). In the cerebellum, BDNF promotes the formation of inhibitory synapses (Chen et al., 2016). Postsynaptically, BDNF and proBDNF are critical to control the GABAARs trafficking between synaptic sites and endosomal compartments. The cell membrane expression of GABAARs depends on their phosphorylation level (Nakamura et al., 2015). Thus, dephosphorylation of the GABAAR ß3 subunits triggers the association with the assembly polypeptide 2 (AP2) complex which leads to a clathrin-mediated internalization (Kittler et al., 2000; Nakamura et al., 2015). In fact, BDNF/TrkB signaling inhibits the internalization of GABAARs through activation of the phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI-3 kinase) and PKC pathways (Figure 1). This ability of BDNF to modulate GABAARs endocytosis and activity is likely to occur due to an inhibition of their interaction with the protein phosphatase 2A complex (PP2A), a downstream target of PI-3 kinase (Jovanovic et al., 2004; Vasudevan et al., 2011). Inversely, application of proBDNF to cultured rat hippocampal neurons cause a reduction in GABAergic synaptic transmission by promoting dephosphorylation and internalization of GABAAR ß3 subunits through the RhoA–Rock–PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) signaling cascade (Riffault et al., 2014). The underlying molecular mechanism of PTEN-mediated dephosphorylation and downregulation of GABAARs remains to be determined but may involve the inhibition of PI3-kinase activity and the subsequent upregulation of PP2A activity. Accordingly, PTEN activated by p75NTR is a major negative regulator of the PI3-kinase signaling cascade (Song et al., 2010). Thus, the cell surface expression levels of GABAARs can be settled by the competition between mBDNF/TrkB and proBDNF/p75NTR intracellular cascades on the PTEN/PI3-kinase-mediated activation of PP2A. After endocytosis, the proBDNF/p75NTR/Rho-ROCK pathway moved internalized GABAARs to late endosomes and finally to lysosomes for degradation (Riffault et al., 2014).

BDNF also regulates genes transcription of GABAAR subunits (Bell-Horner et al., 2006) GAD65 (Sánchez-Huertas and Rico, 2011) and GATs (Vaz et al., 2011), through the recruitment of the ERK-MAP kinase cascade, which activates the cAMP-response element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB; Figure 1; Yoshii and Constantine-Paton, 2010). In an opposite way, the downstream signaling pathway triggered by proBDNF/p75NTR activates the JAK-STAT pathway leading to the induction of the cAMP early repressor ICER, which mediates the downregulation of GABAARs ß3 gene synthesis (Figure 1). Interestingly, the activation of this pathway precedes the decrease of GABAARs ß3 cell surface expression (Riffault et al., 2014).

Other reports have also suggested that in rat visual cortex and cerebellar Purkinje cells, the BDNF/TrkB signaling modulates GABAARs mediated currents through the PLCγ-Ca2 + and CaMK pathways (Cheng and Yeh, 2003; Mizoguchi et al., 2003). In immature cultured rat hippocampal and hypothalamic neurons, the BDNF/TrkB dependent increase in GABAARs plasma membrane expression occurs when activation of GABAARs lead to a depolarization of the membrane potential, which in turn triggers the release of BDNF (Obrietan et al., 2002; Porcher et al., 2011). In more mature cultured rat hippocampal neurons and murine cerebellar granule cells, BDNF decreases the plasma membrane expression of GABAARs (Brünig et al., 2001; Cheng and Yeh, 2003). In parallel, BDNF/trkB signaling reduces the excitability of parvalbumin-positive interneurons in the mouse dentate gyrus (Holm et al., 2009). Surprisingly, these neurons do not express the proBDNF receptor p75NTR (Dougherty and Milner, 1999; Holm et al., 2009). The change in the regulation of GABAARs cell surface expression by BDNF coincides with a shift in GABA polarity (depolarization to hyperpolarization), attributed to the activity of KCC2 (Rivera et al., 1999) which is also regulated by both forms of BDNF. A recent study showed that increased proBDNF/p75NTR signaling disrupts the developmental GABAergic sequence by maintaining a depolarizing GABA response in a KCC2-dependent manner in mature cortical neurons (Riffault et al., 2018). In developing neurons, BDNF increases KCC2 expression on the level of mRNA transcription (Aguado et al., 2003; Rivera et al., 2004; Ludwig et al., 2011). In line with these observations, it was shown that the expression of KCC2 is significantly decreased in trkB−/– mice hippocampi (Carmona et al., 2006) whereas, in adult neurons BDNF decreases both mRNA and protein KCC2 (Rivera et al., 2002, 2004; Wake et al., 2007; Shulga et al., 2008; Boulenguez et al., 2010). In accordance with these results, neurons in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord treated with BDNF showed a depolarizing shift of the GABA reversal potential (Coull et al., 2003, 2005). The actions of BDNF/TrkB signaling on GABAergic synapses are developmentally regulated, with BDNF leading to an increase of KCC2 expression in immature neurons through activation of Shc pathway, and a decrease in adult neurons through activation of both Shc and PLCγ cascades (Rivera et al., 2002, 2004; ​Figure 1).

mBDNF/TrkB and proBDNF/p75NTR signaling pathways regulate γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission. Activation of TrkB receptors by mBDNF leads to an inhibition of GABAAR endocytosis and a consequent increase in the cell surface expression of these receptors through the PI 3-kinase and the PKC signaling pathway. At the transcriptional level, BDNF/TrkB signaling regulates GABAAR and KCC2 gene expression through the Shc, PLC/CaMK or MAP/ERK pathways. Activation of p75NTR by proBDNF decreases GABAARs cell surface expression through the RhoA/ROCK/PTEN pathway that leads to the dephosphorylation of GABAAR and endocytosis and degradation of internalized receptors. At the transcriptional level, proBNDF/P75NTR leads to the repression of GABAAR synthesis through the JAK2/STAT3/ICER pathway. The proBDNF/75NTR signaling also decreases KCC2 expression.
