Canonical YAP/TAZ regulation via Hippo pathway
The core Hippo pathway starts with MST1/2—STE20 family protein kinases, which phosphorylate hydrophobic motifs of LATS1/2 [20]. Phosphorylated, i.e. activated, LATS1/2 then phosphorylate serine residues in YAP/TAZ [11, 21], leading to cytoplasmic retention of YAP/TAZ [21] (Fig. 2). In addition to direct phosphorylation of LATS1/2 by MST1/2, MTS1/2-phosphorylated SAV1 and MOB1A/B facilitate phosphorylation of LATS1/2 [22–24]. While the role of MOB1A/B is not fully understood (Meng et al. proposed a model in which MOB1A/B act as scaffold proteins, but it has not been experimentally justified yet [25]), SAV1 binds to MST1/2, targeting the whole complex to the plasma membrane [26]. For quite a long time, MST1/2 have been deemed to be the primary kinases that phosphorylate LATS1/2. However, it has been shown that double-depletion of MST1/2 does not alter YAP phosphorylation [27, 28]. Indeed, a recent study has shown that MAP4K family kinases act in parallel to MST1/2 to activate LATS1/2 [29].

Impact of cell–ECM interaction on YAP/TAZ regulation
Mechanical environments characterized by cell morphology and the cell–ECM contact area regulate YAP nuclear localization via affecting LATS1/2-dependent YAP phosphorylation [53]. As an underlying molecular mechanism, involvement of integrin signalling has been revealed (Figs. 2 and ​and3).3). Stiff or fibronectin-rich ECM activates the β1-integrin–FAK–Src–PI3K–PDK1 pathway, which inhibits the LATS1/2 activity and thus facilitates YAP nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation [54–56]. The Src–Rac1–PAK pathway also inhibits the YAP phosphorylation by LATS1/2 downstream of β1-integrin [57]. PAK activation induces phosphorylation of Merlin, which abrogates its scaffold function for YAP and LATS1/2, and thereby attenuates YAP phosphorylation by LATS1/2 [57] (Fig. 2). It is currently unknown whether FAK–Src–PI3K–PDK1 and Src–Rac1–PAK axes form a single cascade or act in parallel.
