Molecular structure and PTMs of the Ski and SnoN proteins
The human Ski protein has 728 aa and three main domains (Fig. 4). The N-terminal Ski-dachshund homology domain (Ski-DHD) comprises a region of residues 91–192 with a folding pattern of mixed α/β structures; this domain has lost the ability to bind directly to DNA, but instead behaves as an interacting domain that binds R-Smads and other transcriptional regulators, such as NCoR and Skip.51,56,58,71,118–121 The Ski protein also has a SAND-like domain (residues 219–312) that includes an extended I-loop motif that is responsible for Smad4 binding (Fig. 4).122 Two other N-terminal regions in the Ski protein include a proline-enriched stretch (between residues 61 and 89) and the transformation domain that is localized in the first 304 residues; this last domain is responsible for some Ski activities, such as cell transformation and transcriptional gene repression.49,50,123,124 The Ski- and SnoN-DHD crystal structure reveals that the transformation domain is important for recruiting multiple partners (Fig. ​(Fig.44).121,125,126 The Ski protein differs at its C-terminus sequence, where it has a helical domain that forms a coiled-coil (CC) region constituting two motifs: a region of five tandem repeat (TR) motifs with 25 residues in each, and a leucine zipper (LZ) motif of six heptad repeats; both structural motifs are implicated in the formation of Ski homodimers and Ski/SnoN heterodimers.124,127,128

SnoN is a protein of 684 aa with four conserved domains in its N-terminus: minimal transformation domain, SAND-like domain, DHD domain, and Smad-binding domain. The C-terminus of the SnoN protein is variable and contains a domain for SnoN homodimerization and Ski/SnoN heterodimerization (Fig. 4).122,127,129–131 Four SnoN isoforms have been identified: SnoN (non-alu-containing), SnoN2, SnoA (alu-containing), and SnoI (insertion). All SnoN isoforms result from alternative splicing and almost all are ubiquitously expressed, except SnoI, which is mainly expressed in skeletal muscle. SnoN2 differs from SnoN by a deletion of 138 nucleotides; whereas, SnoI and SnoA encode truncated proteins of 399 and 415 aa, respectively. Although both SnoI and SnoA proteins lack the dimerization domain, only SnoA has a unique domain in its C-terminal region.91,132,133 The four SnoN isoforms have been identified in Drosophila and humans; whereas, SnoN and SnoN2 are the only isoforms expressed in mice.133–135 Nevertheless, the localization, regulation, and function of all SnoN isoforms have not yet been completely revealed.

Ski was initially described as a phosphorylated protein in serine residues.32 Growth factors and hormones, such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and insulin promote Ski protein degradation by inducing its phosphorylation at the Thr458 residue by AKT kinase.136 The Ski protein residue Ser515 is also phosphorylated, but the kinase involved has not been identified; however, mutation of Ser515 does not affect Ski activity as a transcriptional corepressor.137 Ski also interacts with Aurora A kinase (Aurka) through its C-terminal region; Aurka phosphorylates Ski at Ser326 and Ser383 to decrease Ski stability (Fig. 4).138,139 By contrast, TAK1 kinase promotes SnoN protein phosphorylation at residues Ser115, Ser117, and Thr119 after TGF-β treatment, which causes polyubiquitination and posterior degradation of the SnoN protein (Fig. 4).140

Ski and SnoN protein polyubiquitination causes their degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). To date, three main E3 ubiquitin-ligases interacting with SnoN have been identified: the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), Smad-ubiquitination-related-factor 2 (Smurf2), and Arkadia all catalyze SnoN polyubiquitination (Figs. 4 and ​and55).141–148 The Smurf2 WW domains interact with the Smad2 PY motif, and this Smurf2/Smad2 complex recruits the SnoN protein.141,149 SnoN polyubiquitination by Smurf2 requires two segments of the SnoN protein: one region (residues 1–97) binds the Smad2 MH2 domain, and the second region (residues 366–684) harbors the target lysines for ubiquitination.141 APC binds Smad2 and Smad3 proteins to promote SnoN polyubiquitination; in this case, SnoN has a D-box motif between residues 164 and 172 (RLCLPQVLN), which is equivalent to the destruction box of most APC substrates. SnoN protein residues K440, K446, and K449 are the targets for polyubiquitination by APC (Figs. 4 and ​and55),141–143,150 whereas in the case of Ski, the polyubiquitinated lysine residues have not yet been identified. Arkadia was identified as a major positive regulator of TGF-β signaling because it causes the downregulation of Smad7, Ski, and SnoN negative regulators. Arkadia interacts with Ski (at residues 211–490) and SnoN (at residues 263–355) and catalyzes their polyubiquitination in a manner dependent on the recruitment of activated Smad2/Smad3.144–146,148 Recently, it was shown that Smurf2 induces Smad4 monoubiquitination to inhibit its function as mediator of TGF-β signaling, whereas formation of the Ski/Smad4 complex blocks Smad4 monoubiquitination.151

SnoN protein sumoylation requires the participation of Ubc9 (SUMO E2-conjugating enzyme) and PIAS1 or TIF1γ (SUMO E3 ligases); the addition of SUMO occurs at the K50 and K383 residues of the SnoN protein (Fig. 4).152–155 This SnoN sumoylation is important for SnoN-mediated repression of key genes, such as myogenin, in the C2C12 myoblast cell line and for the negative regulation of myogenesis.152,153 Sumoylation of SnoN does not appear to affect its function as a transcriptional corepressor of Smad since the sumoylated SnoN protein can still inhibit the TGF-β-dependent repression of E-cadherin during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. TGF-β signaling inhibits SnoN sumoylation by decreasing PIAS1 levels during EMT of the mammary epithelial NMuMG cell line.154 By contrast, sumoylation of SnoN1 by TIF1γ is necessary during acinar morphogenesis of NMuMG cells to inhibit EMT induced by TGF-β.155 TIF1γ catalyzes only the sumoylation of SnoN1, but not of SnoN2. Regarding Ski, there is lack of evidence about its sumoylation, although Ski interacts with the Ubc9 enzyme to enhance its activity. Thus, Ubc9 promotes MDM2 mono-sumoylation, which in turn promotes p53 protein polyubiquitination and degradation.156
