Discussion
The contribution of epigenomic alterations to tumor progression and relapse has gradually been well recognized by now. To improve the therapeutic efficacy of DLBCL, it will be meaningful to identify critical chromatin modifiers and understand their tumorigenic mechanisms. In this study, we unveil that FBXL10 is a pivotal driver of an epigenetic program that is critical for the tumorigenicity of DLBCL. We provide evidences that FBXL10 accomplishes oncogenic functions through the coordinated repression of BCL6 target genes such as DUSP6 in DLBCL. FBXL10 and PcG proteins form a transcription repressive complex, which recognizes and binds to the promoter region of DUSP6 and maintains the silenced state by catalyzing H2AK119 monoubiquitination and H3K27 trimethylation. Thus, activation of ERK1/2 by FBXL10-mediated repression of DUSP6 contributes to the proliferation and survival of DLBCL cells (Model shown in Fig. 7).

The phosphatase DUSP6 specifically dephosphorylates ERK1/2. FBXL10 represses the BCL6 target gene DUSP6 by recruiting PcG proteins and deposition of repressive histone modifications such as H2AK119ub1 and H3K27me3. The transcriptional repression of DUSP6 hence results in increased phospho-ERK1/2 levels, which are critical for cell proliferation in DLBCL cells
